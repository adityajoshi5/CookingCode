Poet's Prompts
This Android App presents poem writing prompts for hobbyist poets. It uses a pre-created XML file containing random prompts and displays one to the user to write poetry that contains that prompt (phrase or idea). The phrases were created by tokenizing some famous poems and songs. Further version will be better and generate prompts on the fly rather than displaying saved prompts. 
Suggestions are always welcome!
